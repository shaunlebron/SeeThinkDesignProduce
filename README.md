# See, Think, Design, Produce

Notes from lectures by Jonathan Corum, Bret Victor, Mike Bostock, and Edward
Tufte given on May 6, 2014.

Forgive my bad paraphrasing.  I wrote down things that stuck out to me, and I'm
having to remember months later the significance of what I wrote.

## Jonathan Corum

### See

There are two types of moments that happen when you see: pattern recognition,
and learning something new.  Jonathan recounted a childhood amazement he had
after seeing someone walking from a far distance and yet somehow being able to
tell who they were, perhaps due to patterns subliminally learned (e.g. posture,
stride, shape).

Refinement of the eye to free up the brain.  Building pattern recognition
allows you to learn something new.

It's important to see what others have done, to extract the ideas exposed in their work.

It's important to see what's possible (e.g. D3) to enable future opportunities,
to connect future works to patterns past obtained in exploration.

Look at more than you can use.

### Think

Start with a clear thought and write it down.  It's important to get it in
front of your eyes to _see_.  Create evidence of thought to support yourself.
Remember that sketches are not commitments; there should be no hesitation.

You can take something ugly, keep its core, and make it beautiful from high up.

Remember and hold on to the initial "aha!" when you find it.  That is the pure
moment which you can relate to people on a common ground.  Your confidence in
the value of what you're creating can remain separate from the inevitable influences of
the experiment.

### Design

Design for someone else.  Do not be your own audience.  Remember what it's like to not
understanding something.  Relate it to the familiar.

Hold on to your initial self who first saw the problem in confusion, and design
for that self.

Refrain from the desire to collect TRIVIA.  Remember the purpose of what this
is.  But you can find notables in the first draft of the trivia, which can
serve as a framework.

DO NOT IMPOSE DESIGN ON DATA.  DO NOT CREATE FACADES THAT DONT COMMUNICATE.

There is a balance between communication vs. visual appeal.  Violations could be improved upon possibly.

How does one tell what vanity data is?  Vanity data does not reveal "Aha!"
moments. (e.g. comparison of counts vs. displaying counts over area in a map).

### Produce

Production is the process of REFINING.  This is not entirely separate from thinking/designing.

It is the annotation layer above data.  Refine the art and label.  Important to
have skimmable visualizations with embedded info for those who want to go back
and slow down.

The form of the data should grab your attention, but should also extend an open hand
to offer more data if you want it.

Find beauty to convey something impossible to visualize (e.g. an arrow pointing
seemingly at nothing in Venus's orbit to show scale of something that can't be
seen)

Brute force works to compensate for ability.  Understand what you can control.  Be wary of the potential astray from beauty.

Respect the reader because you want to plant an idea that you want spread.  You
are instilling something which you want to remain pure.

### Meta-Presentation notes

```
People love a montage of ideas backed by experience.  (e.g. Photos of sketches at work)

I found some things presented were too fast to absorb.  Some I feel placed too
much focus on visuals without a clear structure of principle.

I would like clear examples of what is correct and what is bad. (clarifying
examples to drive experience-based knowledge)

I had a little trouble relating the impressive examples with the principles.
Yet I was still dazzled.

The presentation format of animation with stills mixed in for breaks worked well.

I found compelling the slides that contained large simple text, for which the
keyword was highlighted to represent the theme.
